🏋️ Fitness Tracker Application (Java Mini Project)
📌 Project Overview

The Fitness Tracker Application is a Java-based desktop application built using Swing GUI.
It allows users to track cardio and strength workouts, calculate calories burned, view workout history, and generate summary reports.

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, exception handling, multithreading, collections, and GUI development in Java.

🎯 Features

Add Cardio workouts with average heart rate

Add Strength workouts with sets, reps, and weight

Automatic user profile management

Calories burned calculation

View workout history (user-wise or all)

Generate fitness summary report

Multithreading to simulate workout sessions

Input validation using custom exceptions

Interactive Swing-based GUI

🛠 Technologies Used

Java

Java Swing (GUI)

AWT

Multithreading

Collections Framework

Exception Handling

Git & GitHub

🧠 OOP Concepts Used
Concept	Implementation
Interface	Trackable
Abstraction	Workout abstract class
Inheritance	CardioWorkout, StrengthWorkout
Polymorphism	calculateCaloriesBurned() overridden
Encapsulation	Private fields + getters
Exception Handling	InvalidWorkoutDataException
Multithreading	UserSession class
Collections	ArrayList<UserProfile>, ArrayList<Workout>
🧩 Class Description

Trackable → Interface for session tracking

Workout → Abstract base class

CardioWorkout → Cardio exercise implementation

StrengthWorkout → Strength training implementation

UserProfile → Stores user workout data

UserSession → Thread simulation of workout

InvalidWorkoutDataException → Custom validation exception

FitnessTrackerApp → Main Swing GUI application
